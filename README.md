# Deprecation notice

This plugin was built for versions of Internet Explorer that didn't support CSS Transforms. All current versions of today's browsers support them, so there shouldn't be a good reason for you to use this.

# Transformie
Transformie is a javascript plugin that comes in less than 5k that you embed into web pages and that brings you CSS Transforms by mapping the native IE Filter API to CSS trandforms as proposed by Webkit.
